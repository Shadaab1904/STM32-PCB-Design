KiCad project:  STM32 PCB Design on STM32F103C8T6

# About
This repository contains the KiCad 9.0 schematic for a custom-designed STM32-based development board. The board is built around the **STM32F103C8T6** microcontroller and provides core functionalities such as USB power, external clocking, GPIO headers, voltage regulation, and indicator LEDs ideal for prototyping, embedded systems development.

It includes: 

STM32F103C8T6:  ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller (Blue Pill)     
USB_B_Micro: USB Micro-B connector for programming/power    
AMS1117-3.3: Voltage regulator (3.3V output)                
Crystal: External crystal oscillator with GND pads     
FB: FerriteBead: Noise filter on power rail
LED: Status or debug indicator
Resistor: For LED and pull-up/down functions
Capacitor: Decoupling and oscillator loading
Conn_01x04_Pin: 4-pin GPIO header                            
MountingHoles: Mechanical support for enclosure/PCB mount
